# Setup prompt
- Language for bridging the gap between human intent and precise computational instructions.
- We're developing a system for seamless human-AI interaction through a Controlled Natural Language (CNL) that maintains precision while remaining intuitive. The system transforms natural language intent into executable applications.
- CNL specification that translates business requirements into unambiguous commands
- The end goal is a simple white page with a prompt where users can type what they want in a structured but natural way, and the system handles all technical implementation details automatically.
- The system should understand this intent and handle all technical aspects (coding, deployment, security, etc.) automatically.
- The end goal is creating a simple interface where users can express what they want in natural language, and the system handles all technical implementation details - from code generation to deployment - automatically.

- Characteristics:
  - Unambiguous but natural-feeling for humans
  - Expressive enough to capture complex requirements
  - Structured enough for reliable AI interpretation
  - Domain-independent
  - Focus on intent/what rather than implementation/how

- Architecture components:
  - Language Parser - Converts natural language to unambiguous commands
  - Intent Resolver - Understands the core requirements and context
  - Task Executor - Handles implementation and resource management
  - Smart Context System - Manages state, preferences, and permissions
  - Resource Manager - Handles dependencies and environment setup

- Technical requirements:
  - Local program creation and execution
  - System resource management
  - Automatic dependency handling
  - Cross-platform compatibility
  - Development environment setup

# Pipeline
## Translation Layer
The translation layer works through several key mechanisms:

### Intent Recognition
- Pattern matching for common request types
- Context analysis for urgency and complexity
- Stakeholder identification
- Timeline extraction
- Implement hierarchical intent mapping to break complex requests into manageable sub-tasks
- Add domain-specific language patterns for different verticals (e.g., data analysis, web development)
- Develop conflict resolution strategies for competing requirements
- Build a feedback loop to improve intent understanding over time

#### Architecture
1. Context Layering System
- Implements multiple context layers (user, system, domain, temporal)
- Each context item has confidence scores and relations
- Context items can be interconnected through a knowledge graph
- Historical patterns are weighted and matched against current requests

2. Intent Resolution Process
- Normalizes raw input for consistent processing
- Breaks down complex intents into sub-intents
- Enriches intents with relevant context from all layers
- Validates completeness and resolves conflicts

3. Pattern Matching
- Maintains a database of successful historical patterns
- Uses weighted matching to find relevant past solutions
- Converts patterns into reusable context items

- Recovery strategies for failed API calls or resource allocation
- Clear feedback loops to users when their intent can't be fully realized
