# Architecture
This diagram illustrates the proposed architecture with several key components:

The AI Orchestration Layer contains:

Central AI Coordinator for high-level decision making
Message Bus for standardized communication


Domain-specific AI services are grouped into:

Frontend Domain: Managing React components, state, and UI optimization
Backend Domain: Handling pattern recognition, context management, and model training
DevOps Domain: Monitoring performance and optimizing resources


Communication patterns shown include:

Solid lines: Direct, frequent communication within domains
Dotted lines: Cross-domain integration where needed
All services connected to the central message bus


# AI Orchestration

The orchestrator handles message routing, load balancing, error handling, and system health monitoring. It maintains metrics about system performance and can automatically scale services based on resource utilization.
Key capabilities include:

Intelligent message routing based on service availability and load
Automatic failover and recovery mechanisms
Performance monitoring and metrics collection
Resource utilization tracking
Error handling and service recovery
Dynamic scaling based on system load
